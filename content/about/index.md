# About

Hello, I'm Andrea, and I love to create and optimize websites. I'm passionate about web performance, web sustainability and user experience.

I write about the web on this tech blog, on [Medium](https://medium.com/@andrea.verlicchi) and [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/andrea-verlicchi/), and I love to speak at web conferences.

I'm a GitHub fan and the proud creator of many open-source projects, [vanilla-lazyload](https://github.com/verlok/vanilla-lazyload) amongst others.

I currently work at [Cognizant Netcentric](https://www.netcentric.biz) as web performance consultant, and product owner for a RUM tool we are developing. [More on LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/andreaverlicchi).

I love nature in all of its forms and - when I'm not geeking around - I love cycling, hiking, eating local food, and all kinds of foreign and regional languages and cultures.
