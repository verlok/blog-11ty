In 2023 I've been speaking about web performance at conferences, Google Developer Groups (GDG) and local meetups all over Europe. The title of this talk is "How and Why ($) to improve web performance, practical tips for 2023".

The first part of the talk is about the reasons why you should optimize web performance, and the second part is about how to do it, with practical tips coming [from Google](https://web.dev/top-cwv-2023/) and based on data collected during the [web performance chapter](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/performance) of the [web almanac 2022](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/).

Find below the slides of my talk, both in English and Italian language.
