During the first half of 2023 I've been talking about web performance at developer conferences, Google Developer Groups (GDG) and local meetups. The title of my talk is "How and why ($) to improve web performance, practical tips for 2023".

The first part of the talk is about the reasons why you should optimize web performance, and the second part is about how to do it, with practical tips coming [from Google](https://web.dev/top-cwv-2023/) and based on data collected during the [web performance chapter](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/performance) of the [web almanac 2022](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/).
