The first part of the talk is about the reasons why you should optimize web performance, and the second part is about how to do it, with practical tips coming [from Google](https://web.dev/top-cwv-2023/) and based on data collected during the [web performance chapter](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/performance) of the [web almanac 2022](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/).
