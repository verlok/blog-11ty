On <time datetime="2025-04-16">16 April 2025</time>, I had the pleasure of speaking at one of the excellent Performance Observer meetups. The Performance Observer community focuses on sharing knowledge and practical insights into web performance monitoring and optimization. You can check out their past and future events [here](https://performanceobserver.dev/events/).

My talk was titled "Debugging and Optimizing Interaction to Next Paint (INP) for a Smoother Web". Here is the video recording of the session:

In this talk, I delved into the practical aspects of identifying and fixing Interaction to Next Paint (INP) issues. I covered common causes of poor responsiveness that I've encountered and demonstrated techniques using browser developer tools and performance monitoring data to pinpoint bottlenecks. The goal was to provide actionable strategies to improve user interaction speed and achieve better INP scores, keeping experiences snappy for users.

The Performance Observer meetups are a fantastic series dedicated to all things web performance, regularly featuring talks from industry experts on monitoring, optimization, and the latest performance metrics. It was great to contribute to this knowledgeable community.
