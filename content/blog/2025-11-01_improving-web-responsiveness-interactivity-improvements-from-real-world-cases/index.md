<time datetime="2025-10-29">On Wednesday, October 29th 2025</time>, I had the pleasure of speaking at the [performance.sync()](https://luma.com/ziykhh4y) event in Amsterdam. It was a pre-conference meetup for the [performance.now()](https://perfnow.nl/) conference, and a great opportunity to meet and learn from other web performance experts.

My talk, "Improving Web Responsiveness - Interactivity improvements from real-world cases", was a 15-minute session where I shared practical techniques for debugging and optimizing slow interactions on websites.

Here's the abstract of the talk:

> Interaction speed is a key aspect of a site’s responsiveness to user interactions. This talk will demonstrate practical techniques for improving slow interactions through real-world case studies of debugging and optimizing poor interaction speed. You’ll leave this session equipped to identify, troubleshoot, and fix slow interactions, ensuring a consistently responsive user experience.

I will add the video of the talk to this post as soon as it will be made available from the organizers.
