On <time datetime="2025-10-29">Wednesday, October 29th, 2025</time>, I had the pleasure of speaking at the [performance.sync()](https://luma.com/ziykhh4y) event in Amsterdam. It was a pre-conference meetup for the [performance.now()](https://perfnow.nl/) conference, and a great opportunity to meet and learn from other web performance experts.

My talk, "Improving Web Responsiveness - Interactivity improvements from real-world cases", was a 15-minute session where I shared practical techniques for debugging and optimizing slow interactions on websites. 

Interaction speed is a key aspect of a site’s responsiveness to user interactions. This talk demonstrates practical techniques for improving slow interactions through real-world case studies of debugging and optimizing poor interaction speed. 

Watch the video of the talk if you want to understand how to identify, troubleshoot, and fix slow interactions, ensuring a consistently responsive user experience.
