In December 2023 I became a Google Developer Expert (GDE) for Web Performance. [Google Developer Experts](https://developers.google.com/community/experts) is a Google program to create a global network of professionals, influencers, and thought leaders, and enable them to share their knowledge with the developer community, like speaking at events, share best practices, and mentor others.

By joining the GDE program, I joined a community of passionate technologists from around the world, allowing me to network with them and Google teams.

In addition to get featured in the Google Developer Experts directory, I will get early access to products and web-performance-related news.
