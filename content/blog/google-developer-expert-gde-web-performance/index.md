In December 2023 I became a Google Developer Expert (GDE) for Web Performance. [Google Developer Experts](https://developers.google.com/community/experts) is a Google program to create a global network of professionals, influencers, and thought leaders, and enable them to share their knowledge with the developer community, like speaking at events, sharing best practices, and mentoring others.

By joining the GDE program, I joined a community of passionate technologists from around the world, allowing me to network with them and Google teams.

In addition to getting [featured](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-andrea-verlicchi) in the Google Developer Experts directory, I will get early access to products and web-performance-related news.

Feel free to [reach out](/contact/) if you want to talk about the program or web performance.
