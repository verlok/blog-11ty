With each new iOS release, I always look forward to exploring the latest features Apple has to offer. iOS 18 has introduced several changes, some small and subtle, others more profound, that have significantly enhanced my user experience. Here are my favorite new features in iOS 18 and why I think they’re a game-changer.

## 1. Bilingual Keyboards: A Seamless Multilingual Experience

One of my absolute favorite updates is the new keyboard functionality that allows me to type in multiple languages without changing the input language manually. It's much better this way! Essentially, iOS 18 offers bilingual keyboards, so I can write messages like:

“Guten Tag! Buenos días! Alles gut? Sí, muy bien! Bom dia! Bonjour! Tudo beleza? Oui, ça va très bien!”

And the best part? I don’t need to switch the keyboard layout every time I change languages. This is a massive improvement, especially for people who frequently switch between languages like I do. It’s a small feature that adds so much fluidity to multilingual conversations.

## 2. Enhanced Dictation: Faster and Smarter

“Hi, I’m trying out the new dictation feature on iPhone 18. It seems to have automatic punctuation also in Italian now. What time did you say we’re leaving today?”

Yes, automatic punctuation is here! It’s a simple yet highly useful upgrade, and it saves me a ton of editing time. But here's a tip: to dictate in English, make sure you have English dictation enabled, as the default Italian setting will only pick up basic English words. It's a small hurdle, but the overall improvement in dictation is undeniable.

## 3. Improved Home Screen, Control Center, and Backgrounds

iOS 18 also made some great strides in customization. Now, managing your home screen and control center is much more flexible. You can freely position app icons on the home screen without the rigid grid system of old. Plus, the background management has become more intuitive, making it easier to switch and organize wallpapers.

## 4. Upgrades to Notes, Reminders, and Calendar

For those of us who use the built-in productivity apps daily, iOS 18 has delivered some helpful tweaks. In Notes, you now have collapsible sections, while in Reminders, the smart lists feature makes managing tasks a breeze. The Calendar app has introduced a new month view that makes scheduling even more efficient. These are small, incremental updates, but they’re invaluable for staying organized.

## 5. Internet Pages Read Aloud (The Real Game-Changer)

This might just be the killer feature of iOS 18. You can now have entire web pages or articles read aloud to you, even with the screen turned off. Siri now gives you controls for play, pause, and reading speed, making it incredibly convenient. Before, I relied on Microsoft Edge for this, but now Siri can handle it, at least for Italian content (as I use Siri in Italian). For English articles, I’ll probably stick with Edge for now, but this feature is a fantastic addition for hands-free browsing.

## 6. A New Password App for Secure Management

iOS 18 also introduces a new password app, which lets you manage passwords, passkeys, and two-factor authentication codes all in one place. It's a handy tool for anyone who doesn’t already use a third-party password manager. Personally, I will still use KeePass and KeePassX because I need to share some passwords with non-Apple devices, and I don't want to get locked out of everything if I lose access to my Apple ID by any chance.

## Conclusion

These are my favourite features that have made iOS 18 such a joy to use. With smoother multilingual typing, smarter dictation, and enhanced customization, Apple has really upped the game. And let’s not forget the convenience of having Siri read web pages aloud or the new built-in password manager. iOS 18 feels like a solid evolution that improves daily tasks, making life just that little bit easier.
