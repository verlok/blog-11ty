On <time datetime="2024-07-17">17 September 2024</time>, I spoke at the We Love Speed 2024 conference about enhancing web responsiveness. Specifically, I discussed how to debug and avoid slow interactions based on my experience on auditing Interaction to Next Paint (INP) on clients' websites. 

The title of the talk was "How I made the web more responsive - real-world case studies of INP optimizations", in French "Comment j‚Äôai rendu le web plus r√©actif ‚Äî √©tudes de cas concrets d‚Äôoptimisations d‚ÄôINP", and this is the video of my talk.

After providing an initial explanation of INP, I demonstrate how to debug slow interactions using both Chrome DevTools and Real User Monitoring (RUM) data. I then illustrate three common mistakes I encountered while auditing INP on dozens of websites and explain how to avoid them to ensure snappy user interactions and keep your INP below 200 milliseconds.
