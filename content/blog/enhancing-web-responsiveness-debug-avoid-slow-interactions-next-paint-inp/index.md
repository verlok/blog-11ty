In May 2024, I began speaking at local meetups and conferences about enhancing web responsiveness. Specifically, I discussed debugging and avoiding slow interactions, which are measured by the new metric Interaction to Next Paint (INP). This metric, introduced in March 2024, is part of the Core Web Vitals.

After providing an initial explanation of INP, I show how to debug slow interactions using Google Chrome's Developer Tools and Real User Monitoring (RUM) data. I also cover three common mistakes to avoid to ensure snappy user interactions and keep your INP below 200 milliseconds.
