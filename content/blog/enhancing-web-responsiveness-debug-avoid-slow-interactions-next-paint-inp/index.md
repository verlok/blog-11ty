In 2024 I've been speaking about enhancing web responsiveness, debugging and avoiding slow interactions, which are measured from the new metric from Interaction to Next Paint (INP), part of the Core Web Vitals starting from March 2024.

After an initial explanation of the new metric Interaction to Next Paint (INP), I show how to debug slow interaction using Google Chrome's Developer Tools and Real User Monitoring (RUM) data, and I go over 3 common mistakes to avoid in order to have snappy user interactions and keep your INP below 200 ms.
