As someone who spends a lot of time on Google Meet, Iâ€™ve often been frustrated by the inability to view shared content in true full-screen mode. Thereâ€™s a lot to be said for maximizing screen space, especially when diving into complex code or detailed design presentations. But for whatever reason, Meet limits full-screen options, leaving borders and UI elements visible, which can be distracting.

I got tired of waiting for Google to provide a solution, so I decided to make one myself. I created a bookmarklet that lets you view shared content in true full-screen mode on Google Meet, removing the extraneous elements and maximizing usable screen space.

Check it out and add it to your browser here:

ðŸ‘‰ [Google Meet True Full-Screen Bookmarklet on GitHub](https://github.com/verlok/google-meet-true-full-screen/tree/main)

There you will find the procedure to add the bookmarklet to your browser, and once added, you can activate true full-screen mode with a single click. 

This simple script aims to improve your meeting experience by keeping the focus on the content that matters.
Let me know if you find it useful, or if there are any tweaks or features you'd like to see added. 

Happy full-screening!
