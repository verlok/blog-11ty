After nearly three years of working fully remotely, six years of "smart-working" (two remotely, three in the office), and more than 15 years working in offices, I’ve gained a lot of perspective on the remote work debate. While I support many of the benefits of working from home, I also recognize the drawbacks, and I think there’s a middle ground that works best.

## The Benefits of Remote Work

Remote work offers clear advantages. First and foremost, it’s effective—allowing for increased productivity, fewer distractions, and better focus when you have the right setup, whether an isolated space at home or a desk in a coworking space. For employees, there’s also the benefit of flexibility. You have the freedom to arrange your schedule more easily around personal commitments and preferences. Financially, it’s a win, too—no commuting costs, no need to buy lunch out every day.

## The Human Element: What We Miss

But remote work isn’t all upside. One of the biggest downsides is the isolation it can bring. It’s easy to compensate for this by staying active, going to the gym, or catching up with friends. Yet, there’s no replacement for the spontaneous exchanges that happen with colleagues when you share a workspace. These informal interactions can spark new ideas and help foster team spirit.

A personal example: just last Thursday, I was in Hamburg for an event at the company office. During a break, I had a casual conversation with one of my colleagues, a working student, and discovered she was preparing her thesis on a topic directly related to a project I’m working on. That valuable connection wouldn’t have happened without the in-person interaction.

There is something unique about the bonds formed through working side-by-side for long hours. In many cases, you spend more time with your colleagues than with your family when working full-time in an office. This is especially true for small teams, where these connections can be strong enough to last years—bonds\* that can remain strong even as you move on to new jobs.

## Finding Balance: A Mixed Approach

In my experience, the ideal setup is a hybrid approach. Work from home most of the time, but with the flexibility to go to the office when needed—for example, for brainstorming sessions, collaborative projects, or important meetings.

I also believe companies should organize regular in-person events—whether workshops or team-building activities—at least four times a year to maintain a sense of connection and shared purpose.

This model strikes the right balance between autonomy and collaboration, ensuring that while we enjoy the flexibility of remote work, we don’t lose the valuable interpersonal connections that fuel innovation and camaraderie in a team.
