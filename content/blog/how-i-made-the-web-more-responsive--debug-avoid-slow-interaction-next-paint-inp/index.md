In May 2024, I started speaking at local meetups and conferences about improving web responsiveness. My talks focus on debugging and preventing slow interactions, drawing from my experience auditing Interaction to Next Paint (INP) on dozens of clients' websites.

After providing an initial explanation of INP, I demonstrate how to debug slow interactions using both Chrome DevTools and Real User Monitoring (RUM) data. I then illustrate three common mistakes I encountered while auditing INP on dozens of websites and explain how to avoid them to ensure snappy user interactions and keep your INP below 200 milliseconds.
