## The community dinner

On the day before the conference, Google holds a dinner event to mix Google Developer Experts (GDE), Women Tech Makers (WTM), Google Developer Groups (GDG) organizers and people who work at Google (aka Googlers) in the GDE program or as developer relationship (devrel).

The aim of the event is to socialize, getting to know more people, networking with the ones you already know, strengthen the personal and professional connection, all of that while eating, drinking and discussing of the latest news about the industry.

I enjoyed the event, spent most of the time chatting with other web performance GDEs and googlers, particularly Barry Pollard and ‚ùóÔ∏è _insert-name-of-googler-working-in-the-developer-tools-team-and-video-of-speculative-prerendering_ ‚ùóÔ∏è) (see group picture above), hung out briefly with the italian GDG community, ended up singing karaoke with my former workmate Ines, and when the event was over I took a long walk to the hotel with Paolo, a Machine Learning GDE who flew in with me from Bologna.

## Main Google I/O event

Google I/O is not a replica of Google I/O, so Google require you to watch the videos of what was presented at the main I/O event beforehand. Then, at Google I/O connect, you have the chance to ask questions to Googlers, who sit on stage, about the topics presented.

The event is divided in many stages (Web, AI, Android, Flutter, etc.) so you can attend the ones you're most interested in. For example, I spent most of the time in the Web stage, at events about the new web UI features, about the latest Angular release, etc.

There, I also had the luck to meet Nishu, who did a very nice job in exploring Interaction to Next Paint (INP) last year and gave a talk about it at the Performance Now confernce, so she's a rockstar to me but I never had the chance to meet her in person.

This event was open to all the people invited to the community dinner, plus other people who occasionally joined the event by purchasing a ticket.

## GDE Forum

The GDE forum was restricted to Google Developer Experts, and had a limited number of seats (150), so only the ones who registered first were able to access it. I was amongst the lucky ones, but I know many who just were in the waiting list and still didn't make it.

So how was this event? First, we had , we were invited to a couple of events,
