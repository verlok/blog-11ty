There’s a new IDE from Google that embraces agentic AI and leverages Gemini 3: [Google Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/).

With Gemini 3's advanced reasoning, tooling, and autonomous programming capabilities, Google Antigravity transforms AI assistance from a tool in a developer's toolkit to an active partner. While the core of Google Antigravity is a familiar AI IDE experience, its agents have been elevated to a dedicated interface and gained direct access to the editor, terminal, and browser. Now agents can autonomously plan and execute complex, end-to-end software tasks on your behalf, while validating their own code.

On Friday, my workmate Brian and I put it to work on some complex task in the development of the project we're working on, with the Gemini 3 model, and we were quite impressed by it.
I wanted to know more on how to use it best, so this weekend I took some time to watch a couple of videos that I highly recommend.

## Learn the basics of Google Antigravity

The first one is "Learn the basics of Google Antigravity" from the Antigravity team.

This video provides an official introduction and walkthrough of Anti-gravity's core components:

*   **Three Main Surfaces**: The tool combines an **Agent Manager** (to create and manage agents), an **Editor** (a full IDE experience), and a **Browser** (incorporating an agent directly inside Chrome for autonomous testing).
*   **Agent Assisted Development**: The LLM is set up to automatically make decisions and implement easy tasks. For complex issues, it can pause and prompt the user for clarification.
*   **Artifacts for Transparency**: The agent generates markdown files like **Implementation Plans** and **Walkthroughs** to document its progress and changes.
*   **Parallel Task Execution**: Developers can kick off a task for the agent and start another complex task themselves.
*   **Autonomous Testing**: The agent can launch the integrated browser to verify its own code changes.

## Google Antigravity: The New Best AI Editor?

This review highlights:

*   **Agent Manager Inbox**: The main interface is designed like an email inbox for managing multiple projects.
*   **Free Gemini 3 Pro Access**: Includes free access to Gemini 3 Pro within the editor.
*   **Complex Task Handling**: The reviewer demonstrates the agent successfully implementing a full-stack feature involving multiple external services (trigger.dev, OpenAI TTS, blob store, database, and UI updates).

It looks like it's gonna change the way we develop, by turning us into... orchestrators of agents?
