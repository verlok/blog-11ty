In Google Meet, if you're working with two screens, you might want to keep the shared content on one screen while keeping the faces of attendees on another. This setup allows for better engagement in the meeting by making it easier to focus on the faces of attendees, chat, and other meeting interactions, while still keeping an eye on the presentation or shared content. Here’s how you can do it with Google Meet's *Companion mode* and a few manual steps.

## Step-by-step guide to using Companion mode

Using *Companion mode* lets you join a Google Meet meeting again from a second tab or window without duplicating audio, allowing you to configure each window individually. Here’s how I set it up:

1. **Set layout for attendee faces**  
   In your main meeting window, click on the `...` (more options) menu, and go to **Change layout**. Choose **Tiled** to make sure attendees’ faces are visible in a grid.

    <figure>
        {% image "change-layout-to-tiled.png", "Change layout. Selection is saved for future meetings. Auto; Tiled; Spotlight; Sidebar. Tiles; Maximum tiles to display, depending on window size. Hide tiles without video.", [648, 1296], "648px", true %}

2. **Minimize the presentation in the main window**  
   If the presentation is pinned, unpin it by hovering over it and clicking the pin icon. This will make the presentation smaller and attendees’ faces larger, ensuring your main focus in this window remains on the people, not the content.

    <figure>
        {% image "unpin-presented-content.png", "Icons to unpin, mute, remove from the call. The tooltip shows 'Unpin'.", [648, 1296], "648px", true %}

    </figure>

3. **Duplicate the Google Meet tab**  
   Right-click on your Google Meet tab and select **Duplicate**. This new tab will be used exclusively for viewing the shared content.

4. **Enable Companion mode in the duplicated tab**  
   In the duplicated tab, choose **Use Companion mode**. Companion mode will join the meeting again without sound, so you won’t have any distracting audio echo or feedback. This secondary window will serve as your content-only view.

    <figure>
        {% image "use-companion-mode.png", "Ready to join? Andrea Verlicchi and Andrea Verlicchi are in this call. Switch here; Present; Use Companion mode; Show fewer options ⬆️", [512, 1024], "512px" %}
        <figcaption>Companion mode is right there, highlighted in blue.</figcaption>

5. **Move the Companion mode tab to a new window and position it on your main screen**  
   Drag the Companion mode tab into a separate window, and move it to your main screen where you want to view the shared content. Now, you’ll have the main meeting with attendees’ faces on one screen and the content in Companion mode on another.

6. **Enhance the Companion mode window with my Google Meet true full screen bookmarklet**
   In the *Companion mode* window, you can use my [Google Meet true full screen](https://github.com/verlok/google-meet-true-full-screen/) bookmarklet to enable a true full-screen mode. This way, the shared content fills the screen without any extra UI elements, making it easier to focus on the presentation.

7. **Bonus step** If you bring the main Google Meet's picture-in-picture (PIP) in the main Google Meet window, it's even possible to bring participants faces in front of someone else's presented content, like you can do with Zoom.

## Why this setup works

This setup keeps attendees’ faces, chat, and controls accessible in the main window, while reserving a second screen exclusively for content. It’s a more immersive experience and a workaround for Google Meet’s current UI limitations.

## Final thoughts

Yes, it’s a bit of a manual process, but until Google improves its dual-screen functionality, these steps are the most effective way to manage meeting visuals across multiple screens. This setup is especially useful for virtual conferences or meetings with high levels of interaction, as it keeps both the presentation and the people engaging with it fully visible.
